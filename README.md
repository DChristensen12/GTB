# Green to Blue

Green to Blue is a personal project that aims to address the problem of environmental degradation and urban heat intensification through the lens of satellite imaging and machine learning. By leveraging publicly available Earth observation data from platforms like Sentinel-2 and Landsat, this project analyzes vegetation health and surface temperature patterns to detect and visualize shifts from ecologically "green" areas to more stressed or urbanized "blue" zones. The goal is to build a lightweight, interpretable model that identifies regions at risk of deforestation, drought stress, or urban heat concentration, providing actionable insights for sustainability efforts. Through this project, I hope to combine technical skill with environmental awareness in a way that highlights the potential of machine learning for real-world ecological applications.
